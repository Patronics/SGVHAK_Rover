  This class implements a subset of the full RoboClaw API released by
  Ion Motion Control.

  This subset was created for testing purposes. it allows running our app in
  the absence of an actual RoboClaw attached to the computer.

  The functional fidelity of this class is poor since it only needs to be
  enough to exercise features of the control application.
